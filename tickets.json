I've left a message for Steve on this one and am waiting for him to get back to me but here's my thinking in the meantime: it's probably not worth sending the device to us at this point as it looks like a communications/connectivity issue - the device is obviously able to connect to the application server but the 'New' status indicates that it can't connect to the mprodigy server.  It needs some investigation.  Steve and his team have access to, and knowledge of, your infrastructure and servers and are best placed to do these initial diagnostics.

We had an MC55 unit sent back to us which was playing up so we decided to wipe it and reinstall everything from scratch. It has a SIM card in it which works fine - i.e. we can connect to the internet and also log into NetMotion. However, Zhenni factory reset the device and re-commissioned it 3 times, and every time the unit failed to complete the commissioning. i.e. it all seemed to work fine but the device stayed at status 'NEW' ont he mProdigy server, and therefore isn't available for remote support.\n\nThe first time Zhenni tried this she didn't delete the device entry from the server. We've done this before and the server just seems to overwrite the existing record. But, as this didn't work, the next 2 times we made sure that the server was purged for anything to do with the device.\n\nPreviously we thought that something was overlooked during the build process or it was due to the SIM cards not being present when the devices were shipped. But this seems to suggest a deeper routed problem that might possibly be related to the device model itself (I don't think we've experienced this on any other models other than MC55).\n\nChris\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Stephen McCorry [mailto:s.mccorry@liplc.com]\nSent: 07 March 2012 06:18\nTo: Rudman, Chris (Business Management, Corporate Services); Padraig Regan\nCc: Ma, Zhenni (Corporate Services)\nSubject: RE: Example of an in-use PDA which isn't commissioned\nHi Padraig,\n\nAre you you happy for the device to be sent to B2M.

This makes life difficult for us as we obviously can't do any remote support on them. The devices are in active use, and therefore have GPRS access, so there is no clear reason why the commissioning process didn't succeed. We discussed getting hold of an example unit for dissection.\n\nWe have now got a unit which demonstrates this behaviour. Where shall we go from here? Should we still send it to B2M for analysis?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nChris\n\nChris Rudman - Maximo PDA Systems Manager\nBusiness Management, Corporate Services\nTelephone: 0551 6570614  |  Internal: 26570614\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc,\nGround Floor, Premier Place\n2 1/2 Devonshire Square\nLondon  EC2M 4BA\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Registered in Scotland No. 90312.

However, despite being completely formatted and recommisisoned several times, it just doesn't complete the process. There shouldn't be any problems accessing the server from that unit as the other devices can connect ok. By definition it shouldn't be an errant setting on the device because it's commissioned with the same profile as the other devices.\n\nWe raised this issue with LI a long time ago, and they suggested back then that you needed to investigate. We've waited patiently for you guys to pick it up as I don't think it is as simple as the unit not having connectivity.\n\nSteve/Jonathan - have you any comments?\n\nChris\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Padraig Regan [mailto:padraig.regan@b2m-solutions.com]\nSent: 13 March 2012 20:47\nTo: Rudman, Chris (Business Management, Corporate Services)\nCc: Ma, Zhenni (Corporate Services); Stephen McCorry\nSubject: RE: Example of an in-use PDA which isn't commissioned\nHi Chris,\n\nI hope you're well.  First of all, sorry for the delay in getting back to you -  I've been running around a lot lately and am just catching up on outstanding emails.  I've left a message for Steve on this one and am waiting for him to get back to me but here's my thinking in the meantime: it's probably not worth sending the device to us at this point as it looks like a communications/connectivity issue - the device is obviously able to connect to the application server but the 'New' status indicates that it can't connect to the mprodigy server.  It needs some investigation.  Steve and his team have access to, and knowledge of, your infrastructure and servers and are best placed to do these initial diagnostics.  It doesn't feel like a device problem but if they need to escalate it to us then we can certainly help out.\n\nThanks,\n\nPadraig.\n\nFrom: Rudman, Chris (Business Management, Corporate Services) [mailto:Chris.Rudman@rbs.co.uk]\nSent: 09 March 2012 12:19\nTo: Padraig Regan\nCc: Ma, Zhenni (Corporate Services); Stephen McCorry\nSubject: RE: Example of an in-use PDA which isn't commissioned\n\nHi Padraig,\n\nI'm just following up to ask if we can send this device to you for investigation. As mentioned, we tried to commission the device (with a working SIM) 3 times and each time it failed to complete and appear in the device manager. This leads me to think the might be an issue with the device itself (we've not experienced it on other device types) rather than it being caused by not being shipped with SIM cards in (as we previously thought).\n\nthanks\n\nChris\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Rudman, Chris (Business Management, Corporate Services)\nSent: 07 March 2012 09:47\nTo: 'Stephen McCorry'; Padraig Regan\nCc: Ma, Zhenni (Corporate Services)\nSubject: RE: Example of an in-use PDA which isn't commissioned\nActually, further to this, Zhenni had another good example yesterday. We had an MC55 unit sent back to us which was playing up so we decided to wipe it and reinstall everything from scratch. It has a SIM card in it which works fine - i.e. we can connect to the internet and also log into NetMotion. However, Zhenni factory reset the device and re-commissioned it 3 times, and every time the unit failed to complete the commissioning. i.e. it all seemed to work fine but the device stayed at status 'NEW' ont he mProdigy server, and therefore isn't available for remote support.\n\nThe first time Zhenni tried this she didn't delete the device entry from the server. We've done this before and the server just seems to overwrite the existing record. But, as this didn't work, the next 2 times we made sure that the server was purged for anything to do with the device.\n\nPreviously we thought that something was overlooked during the build process or it was due to the SIM cards not being present when the devices were shipped. But this seems to suggest a deeper routed problem that might possibly be related to the device model itself (I don't think we've experienced this on any other models other than MC55).\n\nChris\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Stephen McCorry [mailto:s.mccorry@liplc.com]\nSent: 07 March 2012 06:18\nTo: Rudman, Chris (Business Management, Corporate Services); Padraig Regan\nCc: Ma, Zhenni (Corporate Services)\nSubject: RE: Example of an in-use PDA which isn't commissioned\nHi Padraig,\n\nAre you you happy for the device to be sent to B2M.

This makes life difficult for us as we obviously can't do any remote support on them. The devices are in active use, and therefore have GPRS access, so there is no clear reason why the commissioning process didn't succeed. We discussed getting hold of an example unit for dissection.\n\nWe have now got a unit which demonstrates this behaviour. Where shall we go from here? Should we still send it to B2M for analysis?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nChris\n\nChris Rudman - Maximo PDA Systems Manager\nBusiness Management, Corporate Services\nTelephone: 0551 6570614  |  Internal: 26570614\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc,\nGround Floor, Premier Place\n2 1/2 Devonshire Square\nLondon  EC2M 4BA\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Registered in Scotland No. 90312.

findings:\r\n\r\n1. Even though it is not officially supported, I too have run it against a Windows 7 workstation and it works fine. When the Active Sync client completes and says 'Please undock the device to continue' you obviously have to leave it on the dock and once the device has downloaded the profile, it reboots and the Active Sync window closes on it's own and then it uses the network.\r\n\r\n2. I had to open up the messaging port 9001on the Windows Firewall installed on my workstation (in addition to our normal firewall). It would be good to test your connectivity to the server by running telnet to the server & port to ensure your workstation configuration is correct. The error you are seeing is 'normally' seen when the workstation is in a different domain to the server, I think you mentioned that you were running Windows XP mode on your Windows 7 machine, I wonder if this error may be a consequence of this. Ideally you should use a real Windows XP workstation and then you know you are working with the exact same set up as the Agency.\r\n\r\nLet us know how you get on or if you see the same error.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLindsay\n\nB2M Operations","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":129261316},{"created_at":"2012/03/12 18:05:54 +0000","attachments":[{"size":77944,"created_at":"2012/03/12 18:02:38 +0000","content_type":"image/jpeg","token":"strnj9pcxbj4zep","id":118341726,"filename":"Capture.JPG","is_public":true,"url":"https://support.b2m-solutions.com/attachments/token/strnj9pcxbj4zep/?name=Capture.JPG"}],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Ray\r\n\r\nIt turns out that actually we do have an MC3090Z and I have set this up on a machine here today.

It does take a long time to complete the deployment when the allocated SQL memory is so low but that is as expected and it does successfully complete.\r\n\r\nTherefore to help us to try to fix the issue, could I please ask you to let us know when you plan to run a timed profile deployment with an instalation constraint in the future. We can then set up a SQL Profiler session on the live BT server and capture database events as they happen and hopefully help us to diagnose what is happening.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nLindsay\n\nB2M Operations","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":129261316},{"created_at":"2012/03/06 13:34:30 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Lindsay,\nI believe the NWL DW main deployment is complete.\nAt present the next full deployment for NWL will be B2M v3.0 intermediate client.\n\nRegards\nSimon\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":142713306}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2012/01/05 10:25:54 +0000","solved_at":null,"original_recipient_address":null,"external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2012/01/05 10:25:54 +0000","via_id":0,"subject":"Duplicate device actions in NWL deployment","recipient":null,"organization_name":"BT","group_id":20109178,"submitter_id":129211043,"base_score":60,"permissions":{},"latest_recipients":"simon.tomkinson@bt.com support@b2m-solutions.com paul.bagshaw@bt.com jeff.smith@bt.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jeff Smith, Simon Tomkinson","problem_id":null,"status_id":1,"description":"When a deployment is sent with an installation constraint in the future, the server errors and duplicates the deployment to a number of the devices (see attached details to Pivotal Story 22640511 ) Initially this was thought to be due to memory issues on the server but it has happened again today at 15:44 and 15:55.
